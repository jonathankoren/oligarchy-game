Taken from http://brewster.kahle.org/2019/11/30/the-game-of-oligarchy/ this
simulates the basic game and then passes judgement on the winner and losers.

The game is played as follows. Initally everyone starts out with an equal amount
of money. During each round, players are paired off and flip a coin. The
winner takes half of the minimum amount of the two players from the loser.

Even though the pairs are random, and the coin flips are fair, the money
concentrates, just like in real life. When you play this with real people,
the "winners" start to act like they're "skilled" and "entitled" to their
winnings, just like billionares do today.
